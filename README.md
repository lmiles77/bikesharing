# bikesharing

##Overview:

As ride sharing has emerged as a way for people to get to where they want to go from anywhere at just about any time, in addition to automobile transportation such as Uber and Lyft, bike sharing has emerged as a viable option as well. Bike sharing businesses use technology to both track and monitor user information such as birth year and gender while also gathering data like trip starting and ending location, trip duration, checkout day/time, along with bike usage data. Having such a wealth of data about users and bike usage allow business leaders to respond more quickly based on changes in the data. Cities recognize the flexibility this service provides users in allowing them to explore more broadly across their cities and have worked more increasingly to address road safety concerns by creating bike paths, and protected lanes/intersections. City projects are also being planned and developed with bikers in mind, with hundreds of miles or roadways that will be safe for riders. There are many factors that must be considered when trying to determine whether of not a business has the potential to be successful. This analysis does will not address these factors, however it will serve as a starting point in our understanding. I utilized tableau to create the visualizations in this report.

The CitiBikes' data provides us with a lot of meaningful information. The use of technology allows for CitiBikesâ€™ leaders to make informed decision. The slides (pages) I have displayed here are a sample of the many types of data the Des Moines bike sharing business may have should they choose to collect similar data. In slides 1- 4 we  take a look at user information data by gender, peak riding start and end times.  Knowing who users are, can be helpful in targeting like demographics of individuals, or understanding which sector of the demographic we are failing to reach. In slides 5-7 we take a closer look at use based on gender. Both usage and subscriptions are more heavily male dominated. With the goal being to increase usage and subscriptions overall, Des Moines investors may consider how they might market bike use to females as male will already more likely to become users of the service. From here we move into comparison of city populations and tourism. Although far less populated than NYC, Des Moines has a thriving tourism market. According to (https://www.traveliowa.com/), in 2019 over 13.7 million people visited Des Moines over this time. Additionally, according to (https://www.dsmpartnership.com/news-media/news/partnership-news/dsm-is-the-fastest-growing-major-metro-in-the-midwest) Des Moines is one of the fasted growing cities in the mid-west. Many newcomers to Des Moines may be relocating from larger cities who have already implemented reforms to benefit cyclist and would be an easy market of potential customers to tap into. 

Further areas of discovery:

-Where are new residents moving to Des Moines from? Median age?

-How do tourists in Des Moines currently get around?

-Is tourism in Des Moines year round? Is tourism seasonal?

-What are road conditions like cyclists in Des Moines? Are their bike paths and road protected lanes? -How many miles of lanes exist?

##Summary:

With the information I have provided, it is my belief that Des Moines is a good candidate to start a bike sharing business as shown by my data analysis. Do consider, as mentioned in the overview, there are still several external factors that my analysis did not provide clarity on. These factors may pose as a risk against this venture. It is my recommendation that further analysis to be done to better understand other risk factors.
